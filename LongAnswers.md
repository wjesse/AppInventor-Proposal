##Long Answer Questions##

### Interest in App Inventor ###

I use App Inventor to teach applications of code to the students I tutor. I always wanted to see what the developer side would look like, and I would love to contribute to the app that I know and love.

### Interest in introductory programming ###

I work as a tutor, and teach a variety of subjects including computer programming. I use App Inventor all the time, and I like to combine it with Scratch to show applications of code.

### Proposed summer project ###

The project I would like to work on is the Multiple file uploads project. Since I am relatively new to open source (prior experience being only Google Code-In), I would like to tackle an easier task. Also Java is mu
best language, and I am willing to learn GWT before the summer starts.

### Experience with the development tools ###

I have extensive experience with Java. I took the AP Computer Science A course in high school, which taught me the fundamentals of Java, and then I took a course at Caltech (Cs2) that taught
datastructures and algorithms with Java. Also, when I did Google Code In, I programmed in Java for the organization Haiku. Here's the link to some code I wrote for my datastructures and algorithms course.

### Experience with teams, online developer communities and large code bases ###

I participated in Google Code In 2018, and worked for an organization called Haiku. I have also collaborated on class projects in my datastructures and algorithms course, where we used git as well.
